# Learning Management System (LMS) - Project Description

This is a comprehensive Java-based Learning Management System built with Spring Boot. The system is designed to facilitate online education by providing a platform for course management, user administration, and assessment tracking.

## Core Functionality

The Learning Management System implements the following key features:

### 1. User Management

- Multi-role system with distinct user types:
  - Admins : Manage system settings, create/manage users, and oversee courses
  - Instructors : Create and manage course content, assignments, quizzes, and grade students
  - Students : Enroll in courses, access materials, submit assignments, and take quizzes

### 2. Course Management

- Course Creation : Instructors can create courses with titles, descriptions, and media uploads
- Enrollment Management : Students can view and enroll in courses, while admins and instructors monitor enrollments
- Attendance Tracking : OTP-based lesson attendance system for students

### 3. Assessment & Grading

- Quiz System : Supports multiple question types (MCQ, true/false, short answers) with a question bank for randomized selection
- Assignment Handling : Students can upload submissions for instructor review
- Grading System : Combines automated feedback for quizzes with manual grading for assignments

### 4. Performance Tracking

- Tracks student progress including quiz scores, assignments, and attendance
- Provides monitoring capabilities for instructors

### 5. Notifications

- System for alerts and communications between users

## Technical Implementation

The project is built using:

- Backend : Java with Spring Boot for RESTful APIs
- Database : Support for PostgreSQL (based on dependencies)
- Security : JWT-based authentication and Spring Security
- Testing : JUnit with Mockito for unit testing

The codebase follows a standard Spring Boot architecture with:

- Controllers : Handle HTTP requests
- Services : Implement business logic
- Repositories : Interface with the database
- Models : Define data structures
- Configuration : Set up application components

The project uses Maven for dependency management and follows modern Java development practices including the use of Lombok for reducing boilerplate code.

## Project Status

The repository appears to be a work in progress with basic configurations and model structures in place. The authentication system using JWT is implemented, and the project structure follows best practices for a Spring Boot application.

The system is designed to be a comprehensive solution for educational institutions or online learning platforms that need to manage courses, users, and assessments in a structured environment.
